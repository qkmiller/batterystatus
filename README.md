# Batterystatus
#### A status bar utility for DWM

This is a DWM statusbar utility that only shows the remaining battery life of the device.
It's a stripped-down version of suckless.org's dwmstatus utility: https://git.suckless.org/dwmstatus/  
I don't need cpu temperature or time, just the remaining life of my craptop so I can plug it in if it gets low.
The xsetroot program can be used to update the statusbar title, but I didn't want to install it.

To install batterystatus, clone this repo, navigate to ./batterystatus and run ```sudo make clean install```
```console
you@yourhost:~ $ git clone https://github.com/qkmiller/batterystatus
you@yourhost:~ $ cd batterystatus
you@yourhost:~ $ sudo make clean install
Cleaning
Build options:
CC       = gcc
CFLAGS   = -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Os -I/usr/include/X11
LDFLAGS  = -L/usr/lib/X11 -lX11
---------
Compiling batterystatus.c
Linking batterystatus
Copying batterystatus to /usr/bin
```

Then, add ```exec batterystatus``` to the same script you use to run DWM.
It should look something like this:
```console
exec dwm & exec batterystatus
```

You can run ```make clean``` to get rid of the local file generated by make during the build process.
